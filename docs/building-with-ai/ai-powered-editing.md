# AI-Powered Editing in DronaHQ

Once your app is generated (via prompt or image upload), DronaHQ’s AI can help you enhance and evolve it — directly from within the builder. 
You can update component properties, attach actions, or even replace components using conversational prompts.

This allows for an intuitive editing experience, helping you move fast without dragging through menus or settings.

---

## Update Component Properties via Prompt

You can update properties of individual components using prompts and `@mentions`.

For example:
- `@submitBtn change label to Submit and background color to blue`
- `Enable pagination in @tablegrid`
- `Update the label for @jsonForm to Customer Details Form and make it bold`

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: 'calc(46.33333333333333% + 41px)', height: 0 }}> 
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/GsLcXalswdcEeJwq0EoG?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Create and Customize an AI-Powered App"
        frameborder="0" 
        loading="lazy" 
        webkitallowfullscreen 
        mozallowfullscreen 
        allowfullscreen 
        style= {{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', colorScheme: 'light' }} >
    </iframe>
</div>
<br></br>  

#### How to Use
1. Open the AI Chatbot from the left sidebar.
2. Type your prompt using `@componentName` to refer to an existing control.
3. The AI will parse and apply updates immediately to the component.

:::caution
 Make sure your component names are unique and recognizable. When you type `@`, DronaHQ will auto-suggest existing component IDs in context.
:::

This method is ideal for making quick UI tweaks — like updating button styles, label text, visibility rules, or sizing.

:::note
Currently, only a limited set of controls are supported for updating component properties. This [list](#supported-controls) will expand in future updates.

## Add Actions to Components via Prompt

With AI-powered editing in DronaHQ, you can quickly add actions to components by typing simple prompts. These actions can trigger specific behaviors, such as validating a screen, run a query on DB connector , or showing confirmation popup.

  
  <figure>
    <Thumbnail src="/img/build-with-ai/actionai.gif" alt="Chatbot" />
  </figure>

For example:
- `On @loginForm submit click, insert form details into @formFeedbackDB`
- `On @submitBtn button click, validate screen-1 and navigate to screen-2`

#### How to Use
1. Open the AI Chatbot from the left sidebar.
2. Type your prompt  using `@componentName` and desired action.
3. The AI will automatically create and attach the specified action to the component.

Adding actions this way eliminates the need to navigate through menus or open the Actionflow editor — just type your requirements, and the AI will handle the rest.

:::caution
Make sure the action you’re requesting is compatible with the component. Some complex actions might require manual adjustments in the Actionflow editor.
:::

:::note
Currently, only a limited set of actions are supported for generating Actionflows via prompts. 
:::


This feature is great for rapidly implementing behaviors like form submissions, redirects, and API integrations directly from your interface.

## Adding Data Queries to Components via AI

At the moment, the Veda AI Chatbot does not support directly bind data to components using data queries via prompt. However, you can still leverage AI assistant to bind data to your components by using a different approach.

#### How to Use

1. Click on the component (e.g., Table Grid) where you want to bind data.
2. Click on the top Ai assist icon on the component.
3. Enter your prompt, such as "fetch all data from the @[DB Connector Name]".

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: 'calc(46.33333333333333% + 41px)', height: 0 }}> 
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/bgKkFRh58LanOWS4Pwo5?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Configuring and Executing Data Queries"
        frameborder="0" 
        loading="lazy" 
        webkitallowfullscreen 
        mozallowfullscreen 
        allowfullscreen 
        style= {{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', colorScheme: 'light' }} >
    </iframe>
</div>
<br></br>  

This will guide the AI to generate the appropriate data query for you, helping you bind your data source to the component.

:::note
Currently, this is a workaround since direct data query binding via AI prompts is not yet supported. However, with AI Assist, you can still accomplish the task by interacting with the component individually.

# Getting Started 

DronaHQâ€™s Build With AI experience is designed to help you create apps faster, smarter, and with fewer manual steps. Whether you want to generate entire screens from a sentence or tweak individual components using simple prompts, the AI Chatbot is here to make things smoother.

##  Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

To begin using the AI features, you need to make sure the platform has access to an OpenAI API key.

- Go to **DronaHQ Cloud**.
- Open your **Profile Settings**.
- Navigate to the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on **OpenAI Account Settings**.

From here, you can either:

- Use DronaHQâ€™s default OpenAI key â€” great for quick experimentation.
- Or bring your own OpenAI key â€” ideal if you want lower costs or higher usage limits.

To know more refer to our [Configure OpenAI keys](/ai-configure-openai-keys/) documentation.

Once your key is added, youâ€™re ready to start building with AI!


##  Locate the AI Chatbot

Once your API key is set, you can access the AI Chatbot right inside the App Builder.

- Open the App Builder from your DronaHQ app builder.
- On the left sidebar, look for the ðŸª„ AI Chatbot icon .
- Click it to launch the chat panel and start building with prompts.

To know more about creating apps with AI, refer to the [Create Apps with AI](create-apps-with-ai.md).

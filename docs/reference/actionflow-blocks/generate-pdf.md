## Setting up the Generate PDF Action

In your application, there might be scenarios where you need to generate PDF documents as a part of your workflow. With the `Generate PDF` action in Action Flows, you can create PDFs based on predefined templates. Here's how you can set it up:

<figure>
<Thumbnail src="/img/reference/actionflow-blocks/generate-pdf/generate-pdf.png" alt="Generate PDF" />
<figcaption align='center'><i>Generate PDF</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Once you select the action block it will open the data query window and provide you with two options: 

* [GetPDF](https://docs.dronahq.com/binding-data/data-queries/pdf-creator/#getpdf)

* [GetPDFURL](https://docs.dronahq.com/binding-data/data-queries/pdf-creator/#getpdfurl)

Click the links above to know more how to configure them.

AlloyDB is a fully managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database by Google Cloud, optimized for high performance, scalability, and AI integration.

## Configuring Connector

### Prerequisites

1. Authentication Credentials: Obtain the required credentials to connect to your AlloyDB instance. Choose from the
   following options:

   - AlloyDB database username and password.
   - AlloyDB IAM authentication (for Google Cloud-hosted AlloyDB databases).

2. Connection Details:

   - Hostname of the AlloyDB database.
   - Port number for database access.
   - Database name within the AlloyDB host.

3. Firewall Rules:
   - Set up firewall settings to allow DronaHQ (IP whitelist) access to your AlloyDB host.

Ensuring these prerequisites are in place will ensure a seamless integration of AlloyDB with DronaHQ, facilitating
effective data management and utilization.

### Connector Setup in DronaHQ

Configure your database category by providing the details below. Choose between `User and Password` Authentication. Validate the connection using `Test connection` and `Save` settings for a secure and efficient database
setup.

## Adding Database Queries

Once the connector is configured, access it in your Connector Library. Click `Add query` after connection setup. Create
queries, run them, and view responses.

</figure>

:::tip 
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to
controls/actions for runtime use.

## Using AlloyDB Connector

### Data Bind using Data Query

#### Read/Display Data Query for AlloyDB:

After configuring the AlloyDB connector, locate it in Connector Library. To retrieve data from the AlloyDB
database, add a query to read the data.

Query used:

```sql
select * from employees
```

Query explanation:

This query selects all details from the `employees` schema's table, allowing you to display the data.

 <figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/alloydb/get-data.png" alt="Get Data Query" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Get Data Query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Place the Table grid control from the Controls section. Bind data by selecting the AlloyDB connector from
` Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Connector Library`. Choose the relevant query for displaying data and bind the
preferred columns.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/alloydb/display.png" alt="Displaying data" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Displaying data</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Using in Actionflow blocks

#### Delete Data Query:

For data deletion, create a query to remove details related to selected data.

Query used:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = {{id}};
```

Query explanation:

This query operates a delete action on the `employees` table, targeting the user-selected ID (primary key) for
removal.

After saving your query after successful configuration testing.

1. In the table grid's Actions, choose `delete_click`.

2. Build the action flow:

   - Confirm task for user delete confirmation.
   - Server-side action with the delete data query.
   - Bind the id connector key to capture selected row's id.

3. Access id using Use Keywords for smooth action flow.

When creating apps, the layouts enable you to arrange the form components in a logical order well suited to the different devices. It enables you to easily design complex apps in a manner that it becomes easily navigable to the users of any of the devices.

If you design a form with a single column it would be a great user experience for a user accessing it on mobile with standard screen size. However, the same might not be true for a user on a desktop or even a widescreen tablet. In such scenarios, two or even more columns can be a good option for ease of use. 

DronaHQ provides the `Layouts` feature in the `Controls` section. There are different layouts that allow you to design your forms in a multi-column format. Other controls can be added to the layouts to enable you to make even a complex application easy to use on any kind of device.

### Columnar layouts 

like the One Column layout, the Two Column layout, and so on. The Layout container is of type “layout”. When designing complex forms it is recommended that any of the columnar layouts mentioned below should be added to a layout and designed further. Further on you can also add the Layout container to any columnar layout which would be useful to further add the columnar layout and design complex and multilevel forms.

- One Column: Adds a single column for controls, displayed as a single column with multiple rows. Only a single column is visible in Mobile portrait view.
- Two Column: Adds two equal-sized columns. Two columns are visible in Desktop, tablet, and Mobile landscape views, but only a single column in Mobile portrait view.
- Left Sidebar: Two columns with the left column smaller (1:3 ratio) than the right column. Visible on any device type.
- Right Sidebar: Two columns with the right column smaller (1:3 ratio) than the left column. Visible on any device type.

## How to Use Layout Control

In the Layout control section, a Layout control and multiple columnar layout types are available.


- Start by adding a Layout control, then add columnar layout types to it. Add controls to these columns as needed.
- Controls like Text controls cannot be added directly to a Layout control, but can be added to columnar layouts within the layout control.
- You can add a Layout control to a columnar layout, then add further columnar formats to this layout for more complex designs.

An important feature of columnar layouts is the ability to set separate settings for different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet). Under the Columns tab in Properties, you can define column settings for each device type, ensuring optimal layout for any screen size.

The Phone control is designed to receive phone numbers in a composite format, divided into two distinct fields. These fields can be stored in separate columns of a sheet, treating them as individual entities. The Phone control comprises two components - Country Code or Prefix and Phone number, providing unique accessibility for each part of the phone number.

### Binding Data Options

The Phone control consists of two parts: the country code and the phone number. It accepts single inputs for both the country code and the phone number.

#### Country Code

The Country Code field allows users to input their country code as a string, e.g., `+1` for the United States, `+44` for the United Kingdom, etc.

#### Phone Number

The Phone Number field allows users to input their phone number as a number, e.g., `1234567890`.

Users can directly enter the country code and phone number in their respective fields without using an array. 

#### Phone Placeholder   
A prompt that gives a hint to the user about the expected input in the Phone field.

title: DronaHQ Support Policy
---


This DronaHQ Support Policy ("**Policy**") is subject to the terms and conditions between DronaHQ and Customer, as referenced in the applicable Order Form (the "**Agreement**"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Policy will have the definitions given to them in the Agreement.

## Applicability

This Policy describes DronaHQ's support services under the following Support Plans:

- Enterprise Support (applicable if Customer has purchased an "Enterprise" level Services subscription under the current Order Form)
- Premium Support (applicable if Customer has purchased the "Premium Support" subscription under the current Order Form)

## DronaHQ Support

At all times during the subscription term of the Order Form, DronaHQ will maintain a sufficient number of personnel who are experienced, knowledgeable, and qualified in the use and support of the Services. DronaHQ will respond to Customer's support tickets related to the Services, which must be submitted by Customer to a DronaHQ Support Channel ("**Support Tickets**"), in accordance with this Policy. All support by DronaHQ will be performed remotely and in the English language.

The DronaHQ Support Channels available to Customer will depend on Customer's current Support Plan:

| DronaHQ Support Channel | Enterprise Support | Premium Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DronaHQ Help Portal (located at** [docs.dronahq.com](http://docs.dronahq.com) **or such other successor URL)** | √ | √ |
| **Slack Support Channel** | Not available | √ |

### Slack Support Channel

Customers with the Premium Support Plan have the option to get connected with DronaHQ tech experts via a shared channel connected to DronaHQ's Slack Organization. If DronaHQ receives a Support Ticket for the same issue in both the Help Portal and the Slack Support Channel, DronaHQ will be permitted to close one of the tickets provided that assistance resumes in the other channel. To ensure streamlined communication and efficient responses, DronaHQ recommends using one channel when submitting Support Tickets for each issue.

## Support Hours and Regions

DronaHQ's support hours are based on Customer's current Support Plan and the priority level of Customer's request.

|  | Enterprise Support | Premium Support |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Priority Level Descriptions; Target Response Times

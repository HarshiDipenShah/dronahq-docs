The scope, deliverables, fees (or hourly rates for time-and-materials engagements), and responsibilities for all Expert Services shall be set forth in the applicable Order Form and an associated Statement of Work (“SOW”), each of which must be mutually executed in writing.

#### 7.2 DronaHQ Indemnification

DronaHQ shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Customer from any third-party claim that Deliverables or DronaHQ Technology, as delivered under this Addendum, infringe third-party intellectual property rights, provided such claims do not arise from the use of Customer Materials or instructions.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

Neither party’s aggregate liability arising from or related to Expert Services shall exceed the total fees paid by Customer for those Expert Services under the applicable Order Form, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

#### 8.2 Exclusion of Damages

title: Data Request Policy
---

When necessary to operate and maintain our Services, DronaHQ processes Customer Data. Occasionally, third parties—including end users and government authorities—seek additional access to or removal of that data. This Policy sets out how DronaHQ handles such requests. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the [Customer Terms of Service](/legal/customer-terms). If there is any conflict between this Policy and those Terms, the Terms will control.

## 1. Individual Requests for Customer Data

**1.1 Directed to Customer.**

Individuals must submit requests for access to or deletion of their information directly to the Customer that owns the data.

**1.2 DronaHQ’s Role.**

While we generally follow Customer instructions regarding retention or removal of Customer Data, we reserve the right to delete any content that violates our policies or applicable law. For example, we will remove—and report—any materials depicting the sexual exploitation of minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

## 2. Legal or Governmental Requests

**2.1 Submission Requirements.**

All legal process (e.g., subpoenas, warrants, court orders) demanding Customer Data must be served on DronaHQ at [**legal@dronahq.com**](mailto:legal@dronahq.com) and include:

- **Requesting Authority:** Name and jurisdiction of the issuing body.
- **Case Reference:** Criminal or civil matter identifiers.
- **Data Description:** Precise Customer Data sought, including the Customer’s name and, if applicable, the individual User’s identifier.

**2.2 Narrow Scope.**

Requests must comply with applicable law and be narrowly tailored to the specific data. DronaHQ will interpret all process strictly and decline to comply with overbroad demands.

**2.3 Compelled Disclosure.**

Except for emergencies to prevent death or serious harm, we will not disclose Customer Data unless compelled by a valid, binding legal order. Where permissible, we will notify the affected Customer before disclosure so it may seek protective relief—unless prohibited by law or we believe the request concerns illegal activity or poses imminent risk.

**2.4 Cost Recovery.**

Customer is responsible for any reasonable costs DronaHQ incurs in responding to legal requests for Customer Data.

## 3. Service of Process

DronaHQ must be served in a jurisdiction where we are subject to suit, or via our registered agent. We do not accept direct service from foreign law enforcement; such agencies must proceed through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties or equivalent diplomatic channels.

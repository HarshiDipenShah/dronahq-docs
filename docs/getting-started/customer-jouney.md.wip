---

The goal is to showcase a customer journey within DronaHQ that empowers users to understand DronaHQ adoption with various roles at different stages, to build internal tools efficiently.

## Different Adoption Stages

1. #### Individual Users/Small Teams: 
    These users typically start with a single, specific application. DronaHQ offers an intuitive interface equipped with pre-built components, facilitating swift development. This enables them to quickly build and deploy their tools without the need for extensive technical expertise.
2. #### Growing Teams/Departments: 
    As teams expand and develop more applications, DronaHQ provides scalability features along with role-based access control. This ensures easy collaboration among team members while maintaining security and access privileges based on individual roles within the organization.
3. #### Enterprise Adoption: 
    As DronaHQ becomes adopted on a broader scale within an organization, it offers advanced administrative tools for centralized management. Integration with single sign-on (SSO) enhances user experience by providing a unified login mechanism across various platforms. Additionally, robust monitoring capabilities empower administrators to track usage metrics and ensure optimal performance and compliance across the enterprise environment.

## Key Roles

### DronaHQ Administrator
    Responsible for managing user access permissions and configurations within the DronaHQ environment. This role ensures the smooth operation of the platform by setting up and maintaining environments tailored to the organization's needs, thereby optimizing performance and usability.
### DronaHQ Developer
    Tasked with utilizing the features of DronaHQ to build internal tools efficiently. Developers leverage the platform's drag-and-drop interface to design applications, employ data binding techniques to link data sources to the application interface, and implement custom logic to enhance functionality according to business requirements.
### DronaHQ Maintainer
    This role focuses on ensuring the health and stability of the DronaHQ system. Maintainers monitor system performance, diagnose and resolve issues, and implement preventative measures to mitigate potential disruptions, thereby ensuring uninterrupted service for users.
### DronaHQ End-user
    As the beneficiary of the applications developed within DronaHQ, end-users interact with these tools to automate processes and streamline workflows. They utilize the functionalities provided by developers to accomplish tasks more efficiently, thereby enhancing productivity and driving organizational success.

## Enhancing the DronaHQ Experience


- Intuitive UI Construction: Implement a visual development environment with drag-and-drop functionality and pre-built UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, tables) for common user interface elements. This will expedite the application development process.

- Simplified Data Connectivity: Provide robust integration capabilities with various data sources, including relational databases and application programming interfaces (APIs). This will streamline data access and manipulation within internal tools.

- Empowered Data Visualization: Equip developers with tools to construct interactive dashboards and visualizations. These visualizations will enable users to gain deeper insights from the data within applications.

- Robust Scalability and Security: Ensure DronaHQ's architecture can accommodate a growing number of applications while enforcing role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC will guarantee secure collaboration by defining user permissions based on their roles within the team.

- Centralized Administration: For large-scale deployments, offer centralized administration tools for managing users, environments, and access control across the organization. This functionality will simplify DronaHQ management for IT teams.


## Customer Journey

The following Customer Journey would be representative of an Enterprise-wide adoption of the DronaHQ Platform. This is an example customer journey for enterprises where initial work is performed by Administrators to define the resources, installation, and configuration of the DronaHQ Platform. DronaHQ Developers are onboarded to the application and given permission to the appropriate resources to support their development. Working with the organization, a business use case is identified, and the developer starts creation of the application. As the application is released, end-users can onboard, test the application and provide feedback. Finally, DronaHQ Maintainer will monitor the applications created.
